## Project Overview

CampusMobinav is an innovative application developed during a hackathon focused on social good. It aims to provide the shortest and most accessible paths for individuals with mobility needs around the Marietta campus. Leveraging the power of Python and the NetworkX library, CampusMobinav ensures that users can navigate the campus efficiently and safely. This project addresses the unique challenges faced by individuals with mobility impairments, offering them a reliable tool to find the most convenient routes tailored to their specific needs.

## Features

- **Shortest Path Calculation**: Utilizes NetworkX to compute the shortest and most accessible routes between any two points on the Marietta campus.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and intuitive interface designed to cater to users with varying levels of technical expertise.
- **Accessibility Focus**: Routes are optimized for individuals with mobility impairments, considering factors such as ramps, elevators, and pathways with minimal obstacles.
- **Real-Time Updates**: Provides up-to-date information on route conditions, ensuring users have the latest data for their journey.
